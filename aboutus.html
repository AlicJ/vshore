				<p>Founded in 2013, Vshore is an Internet mobile app company that is dedicated to starting a new era in the social networking e-commerce platform. Coming from the combination of "Victory" and "Shore", Vshore is an entity that aligns its philosophy very much like a corsair of yester years, where private ships commissioned by the governments were asked to patrol and protect territorial lands for the betterment of all. As a company that has inherited the spirits of corsair, Vshore is committed to building a team with integrity, creativity, diversity, and energy all centered around the common good for all people.</p>
