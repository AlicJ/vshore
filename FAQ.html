  make a purchase, but rest assured that
    if the total cost of the item you're buying is covered by your credits
   and/or balance, we will not charge your card.
  </p>
  
  <h3>I purchased an item, but did not receive an email confirmation. What do I do?</h3>
  <p>
    If you have placed an order and have not received an order 
  confirmation email, please check to see if we have the correct email 
  address associated with your account. To verify your email address, go 
  to the Account Tab → My Profile.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: We are unable to resend order confirmation emails. However, you 
  can check the status of your order directly within the app by clicking 
  on your Account Tab and selecting My Purchases.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Oops! I accidentally purchased an item. What should I do?</h3>
  <p>
    You may cancel your order through the app within 3 hours of the order 
  being placed. To cancel an accidental purchase, click on your Account 
  Tab → My Purchases → Problems/Order Inquiry → Accidental Purchase. 
  Please note that once an order has been shipped, we will not be able to 
  cancel it.
  </p>
  
  <h3>When can I expect to receive my order?</h3>
  <p>
    Please allow 1-2 weeks to receive your order, as we allow our sellers 
  up to 7 days to ship out their orders. However, the majority of our 
  sellers ship their orders within 3 days of purchase. All orders are 
  shipped using USPS Priority Mail, which is delivered between 2-3 
  business days.
  </p>
  <p>
    After you place your order, we work behind the scenes with the seller 
  to get your order to you as soon as possible. Typically, when a package 
  is first scanned into the USPS mail stream, both you and the seller will
   receive an email providing you with tracking information.
  </p>
  
  <h3>I never received my order. What should I do?</h3>
  <p>
    You are protected every time you place an order on vshore with Posh 
  Protect. If your order never arrives, we'll refund you your payment.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, check to see if your order has shipped. You can do this by 
  going to your Account Tab → My Purchases. Click on the item you 
  purchased and check the order status. If your order hasn't shipped, we 
  suggest you contact the seller by commenting on the listing.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your seller doesn't ship your order within 7 days of purchase, you 
  have the option to cancel your order and get a full refund. You can do 
  this by going to your Account Tab → My Purchases → Click on the item you
   purchased → Problems/Order Inquiry.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your order has shipped but never arrived, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@vshore.com">support@vshore.com</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>My order was cancelled. When will I receive my refund?</h3>
  <p>
    When an order is cancelled, we process a full refund back to the original payment method right away.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you used a credit card, please note that we send the funds back to 
  your bank within 2 business days of order cancellation, but the exact 
  date that your bank posts it to your statement can vary depending on the
   bank. Please allow up to 1 full billing cycle for your bank to post 
  your refund to your statement.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you used Posh Credits or Redeemable Balance, the funds will 
  immediately return to your account at the time of order cancellation.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What should I do when I receive my order?</h3>
  <p>
    Once you have received your order, please ensure your purchase is as 
  described within the listing. If everything is okay with your order, 
  accept the order so that we can release your payment to the seller. You 
  can do this by going to your Account Tab → My Purchases → Accept. Please
   note that vshore will automatically release payment to the seller if 
  the order is not marked as received after 3 days of delivery.

  within 3 days of delivery by opening a case with us within the app. To

  you purchased → Problems/Order Inquiry.

  lovers (like you!) meet up in the vshore app to shop, share, and sell 
  clothing and accessories. We currently host 3 parties per day within the
   app with varying party themes. After the parties are over, check out 
  the different showrooms within each party to shop for curated selections
   of items shared to that party.

  handbags under $100" or "Moto and Biker Jackets". Use showrooms to shop 
  and explore curated listings. Showrooms constantly change and are 
  personalized towards each user who views them.
  </p>

  
  <h3>How do I sell on vshore?</h3>
  <p>
    To create a listing, click on the "sell" button (the camera icon) in 
  the app, take photos of the item you wish to sell, fill in the required 
  information (description, price, size etc) and voila - you've made a 
  listing!
  </p>
  <p>
    Please remember to only list items that fall within our <a href="#what_can_i_sell">selling guidelines</a> and to accurately describe your item!
  </p>

  
  <h3>What will help my listing sell faster?</h3>
  <p>
    Sell your items quickly by following these helpful tips:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use great lighting when taking pictures! Buyers want to clearly see the item.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a beautiful Covershot photo by modeling and/or styling the item.
    </li>
    <li>
      Carefully review your item while listing and include additional photos showing any damage, excessive wear, or stains.
    </li>
    <li>
      Write a thorough description for your listing by including the 
  item's condition, color, size, material, measurements, and any wear or 
  damage.
    </li>
    <li>
      Share your listing with followers or friends on vshore or through 
  Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, email or SMS easily

    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>What are the fees for selling on vshore?</h3>
      <p>
        Our fees are very simple and straightforward. For all sales under $15, vshore takes a flat commission of $2.95.
        You keep the rest. For all sales over $15, you keep 80% of your sale and vshore's commission is 20%. Once your
        sale has been delivered and received by your buyer, the earnings from your sale are yours. You can spend your
        earnings within the app or withdraw your money as cash whenever you like.
      </p>
  <p>
        <a id="what_can_i_sell"></a>
    We at vshore like simplicity. Unlike other places, there is no 
  nickel and diming - we handle the financial transaction for you 
  (including paying credit card fees),
    provide you with a pre-paid, pre-addressed shipping label, and we will
   serve as your customer support team for your sale.
    In other words, we provide a simple end-to-end platform for selling 
  fashion!
  </p>
  
  <h3>What can I sell on vshore?</h3>
  <p>
    vshore is a marketplace for women's fashion and accessories. Please 
  refrain from listing items that do not fall into this category. Such 
  listings clutter the marketplace and make shopping for fashion more 
  difficult and less enjoyable for others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pre-owned items can be listed on vshore if they are clean and in 
  good condition. All items must be clearly and accurately represented.
  </p>
  <p>
    vshore prohibits the sale of replicas or fakes. Please join us in 
  respecting and celebrating the intellectual property and creativity of 
  today's fashion designers. Members who buy, list, or otherwise attempt 
  to sell replicas or fakes risk immediate and permanent suspension from 
  vshore.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not condone the buying or selling of electronics, books, dvds, 
  home goods, used makeup, used swimsuits, used undergarments, and any 
  health and wellness products. Any listings in these categories will be 
  removed from search or deleted.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we feel that your listing violates these guidelines in any way, we 
  reserve the right to remove it and may take other actions, including 
  restricting your future buying and selling privileges on vshore.
  </p>
  
  <h3>I just made a sale! How do I ship?</h3>
  <p>
    Congratulations on your sale! When your item sells, we automatically 
  send you a pre-paid, pre-addressed USPS Priority Mail shipping label. 
  Please ensure you use our shipping label to ship out your order to avoid
   any delay
    in receiving your earnings, as each label has a tracking number 
  connected with each order for us to track on our end. If our shipping 
  label is not used, we cannot compensate or reimburse users if a package 
  is lost in transit since we will not have access to any tracking 
  information.
  </p>
  
  <h3>I can't find my pre-paid shipping label in my email. What do I do?</h3>
  <p>
    Not to worry! Double check that we have the correct email address on 
  file for you. You can check this in the app by going to your Account Tab
   → Edit Profile.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your email address is correct or you have changed it in the app, 
  please re-send this label to yourself. Simply go to your Account Tab → 
  My Sales → Select your order → Need new shipping label.
  </p>
  <p>
    Are you still not receiving your shipping label? Contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@vshore.com">support@vshore.com</a>.
    We'll be happy to find it for you.
  </p>
  
  <h3>My package weighs over 5 pounds. How do I upgrade my shipping label?</h3>
  <p>
    Labels for packages over 5 pounds will incur an extra label upgrade 
  fee per the table below, to be paid for by the seller. If your package 
  is over 5 pounds, you will need to generate a new shipping label in the 
  app. Go to your Account Tab → My Sales → Select your order → Need New 
  Shipping Label → Need Heavier Weight Label. Please make sure you select 
  the total weight of your package so that a shipping label with the 
  correct weight can be generated and sent to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember, any additional shipping costs for packages over 5 pounds are
   paid for by the seller and will be automatically deducted from your 
  earnings/credits.

  <h3>I shipped my sale. How do I get paid?</h3>
  <p>
    When your item sells, we automatically send you an email with a 
  pre-paid, pre-addressed USPS Priority Mail shipping label attached. 
  Please package your item, print the label, and adhere it to your 
  package. Then drop it off at the post office or schedule a pick up with 
  USPS.com.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the buyer receives the item, we release the money to you within 3
   days of delivery into your vshore account. You can withdraw the money
   via direct deposit to your bank account or request a check.
  </p>
  
  <h3>How can I trust selling on vshore?</h3>
  <p>
    We want you to feel secure when selling on vshore. When your item 
  sells, we send you a pre-paid, pre-addressed USPS Priority Mail shipping
   label to put on your package. As long as you use the vshore-provided 
  label and the package is scanned into the USPS tracking system, you will
   be fully covered by vshore should the package get lost in transit by 
  USPS. Any orders over $400 will require a signature upon delivery to 
  provide additional protection.
    When the package is first scanned into the USPS mail stream, we send 
  both you and the buyer an email with the tracking information. When USPS
   tells us the item has been delivered, we notify the buyer and ask them 
  to review and accept their order. Once your order has been delivered and
   accepted by your buyer, we will release your funds and you can redeem 
  your earnings from vshore via direct deposit or request a check.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a buyer reports a problem with their order, we will ask them to 
  upload details and photos. The vshore team then carefully reviews the 
  case and offers a resolution.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What is vshore's Return Policy?</h3>
  <p>
    All sales are final on vshore. However, we take an active role in 
  each and every purchase made on vshore to ensure both the buyer and 
  seller have a great experience. A buyer may open a case with us if they 
  don't receive their item or the item they receive is not as described 
  within the listing. This means a buyer cannot return an item they 
  purchased on vshore if the item simply does not fit or they no longer 
  want the item - as long as the seller accurately described the item in 
  the listing.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the buyer receives an item that is not as described within the 
  listing, is sent the wrong item, or is in some other way not as 
  described, the buyer can report their problem to us within 3 days of 
  delivery through the app or on the web. When a case is opened, the buyer
   is asked to upload photos and offer details of the item. If the return 
  is verified, we assist the buyer in returning the item to the seller and
   offer them a full refund.
  </p>
  <p>
    To avoid a problem with a sale, we advise sellers to be as descriptive
   and detailed as possible when creating your listings. We encourage 
  buyers to review the listing photos, description and item condition, and
   if you have any questions, please ask the seller for additional 
  details, measurements or photos. Sellers are usually more than happy to 
  provide additional information.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What happens when my buyer has reported my item as not as described?</h3>
  <p>
    When a buyer reports a problem with their order, we ask them to submit
   supporting documentation including photos and a list of issues. Our 
  team will then review the photos and information provided, the seller's 
  listing (photos, description and all communication between buyer and 
  seller), and other relevant documentation prior to coming to a 
  resolution. We recommend that all sellers accurately describe their 
  items by providing clear, representative photos that fully show the 
  condition of the item and a detailed description.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both the buyer and seller will be notified via email once there is a resolution.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Do you support international shipping?</h3>
  <p>
    We do not support international shipping outside of the United States and its Territories at this time.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Do you ship to APO or military addresses?</h3>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, our shipping label provider does not support shipping to APO or military addresses.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Do you ship to PO Boxes?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, we support shipping to PO boxes.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What kind of boxes can I use to ship out my order?</h3>
  <p>
    vshore sends all items via USPS Priority Mail. This means that you 
  can pick up FREE boxes at your local post office or have them delivered 
  right to your home by ordering them on www.usps.com. They come in a few 
  different sizes so you can pick the one that fits your item best.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just remember - and this is important! - you need to ship using the 
  boxes that are labeled simply "Priority Mail". Any other USPS boxes, 
  including "Priority Mail Flat Rate", "Regional Rate" and "Express Mail" 
  are NOT allowed and may cause delays in shipping and receiving your 
  earnings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good news: standard brown boxes and padded envelopes that you have around the house work just as well!
  </p>
  
  <h3>How do I redeem my earnings from my vshore account?</h3>
  <p>
    The fastest way to get your money from vshore is through direct 
  deposit into your bank account, but you can also request a check. Here's
   how to set it up:
  </p>
  <p>
    In the app:
    <br>
    Go to the Account Tab → My Balance → Redeemable Balance and select 
  your desired redemption method to set-up a direct deposit (or request a 
  check, if preferred).
  </p>
  <p>
    On the web:
    <br>
    Go to the Account Tab → Orders → My Balance → Redeem Your Balance Here and select your desired method of redemption.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Can I trade on vshore?</h3>
  <p>
    Trading is allowed on vshore.  However, our Posh Protect policy does
   not cover trades within the system.  When payment for the full value of
   items is not exchanged through the vshore system, we cannot guarantee
   that both parties will ship their items to each other as promised or as
   described.  Trading is based on an honor system and is difficult for us
   to support.  For this reason, we discourage users from trading on 
  vshore as they are not protected.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What should I do if someone asks me to take a transaction offline?</h3>
  <p>
    Encouraging vshore community members to buy or sell outside of 
  vshore either through Paypal or other means is prohibited. Taking 
  transactions offline is harmful and hurts everyone who plays by the 
  rules.
    Members who repeatedly take transactions offline may have their future
   buying and selling privileges restricted on vshore. When money is not
   exchanged through the vshore system, we can’t guarantee that both 
  parties ship and transact as promised.
    As a result, our Posh Protect policy does not cover any transactions 
  done off of the vshore platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are approached to take a transaction offline, please contact us immediately at
        <a href="mailto:support@vshore.com">support@vshore.com</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>How can I report a bad listing or user?</h3>
  <p>
    You may report a listing that violates our policies and guidelines at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the app:
    <br>
    Click on the listing → Click the icon in the upper right hand corner 
  of the screen → Click the 'Report Listing' button → Choose the reason 
  for reporting the listing.
