Our Fee Policy is available at <a href="http://www.vshore.com/fee_policy">http://www.vshore.com/fee_policy</a> and is LLCorporated herein by reference. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. In addition to the payment of the applicable purchase price for a purchased item, buyers are responsible for paying all shipping costs to VSHORE (which shipping costs are detailed in the Fee Policy) and all applicable sales, excise, import, export, VAT and other taxes or duties associated with the purchase and sale of any items through the Service. All such shipping costs and taxes are not LLCluded in the listed price for any items made available from sellers through the Service, but will be displayed to buyers before confirmation of any purchase. Sellers are responsible for all LLCome taxes associated with the purchase and sale of any items through the Service. For clarity, all shipping costs paid will be retained by VSHORE. </p>
		<p><span class="bold">Credit Card Transactions</span>: To the extent you as a buyer effect any transactions using a credit card, you must have a valid credit card on file, and we will (or a third party credit card processor may) store your credit card information. VSHORE will verify your credit card information (LLCluding expiration date and billing address), but will not charge your credit card unless you conduct an activity through the Service that requires your credit card to be charged. By agreeing to pay for a transaction with your credit card, you authorize us to charge your credit card.</p>
		<p><span class="bold">Fee Modifications</span>: We reserve the right to change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, some or all of the fees for the Service (LLCluding to lower fees for promotional events), and such changes are effective when we post information about the fee change through the Service. Additionally, we may change our Fee Policy at any time and in our sole discretion, and any changes to the Fee Policy are effective upon the posting of such changes to the Fee Policy. </p>

VSHORE only provides a service, is not involved in any transaction between buyers and sellers who use the Service, does not obtain title to any purchased items and does not act as the buyer or seller (or agent for buyers or sellers) with respect to any such transactions. VSHORE is not affiliated with or endorsed by any designer, manufacturer, retailer or brand of the items that users buy or sell on VSHORE's marketplace. There are risks that you assume when dealing with other users (LLCluding those who may be acting under false pretenses). You agree that all of these risks are borne by you, and not VSHORE. VSHORE does not control the behavior of users of the Service or the information or other content provided by other users that is made available through the Service. As a result, VSHORE does not guarantee or endorse the authenticity, quality, safety, or legality of any items offered or sold, the truth or accuracy of any listings, or the ability of sellers to sell items or of buyers to buy items. We cannot assure that all transactions will be completed. Additionally, VSHORE does not guarantee the ability or intent of users to fulfill their obligations in any transactions. VSHORE reserves the right to delay the completion of any transaction for a reasonable period of time for purposes of fraud detection and otherwise protecting VSHORE and its users from illegal or wrongful activities. </p>
		<p class="bold">FOR EVERY TRANSACTION THAT IS COMMENCED THROUGH OUR SITE, YOU MUST MAKE YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION REGARDING THE STATEMENTS, PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS OR THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE OTHER PARTY AND THE PARTY'S ABILITY TO PAY FOR OR DELIVER THE ITEM(S) OFFERED. PLEASE USE CAUTION, COMMON SENSE, AND PRACTICE SAFE TRADING WHEN DEALING WITH OTHER USERS OR OTHERWISE USING THE SITE. </p>
		<p><span class="bold">Item Comment System</span>: User authentication on the Internet is difficult. VSHORE may attempt, but is under no obligation, to independently confirm a user's purported identity. Therefore, we have established an item commenting system to help you evaluate the user with whom you are dealing. We also encourage you to communicate directly with potential buyers or sellers through the features available through the Service. </p>
		<p><span class="bold">Listing Restrictions</span>: VSHORE prohibits the listing or sale of any item that is illegal to sell under any applicable law, statute, ordinance, or regulation, LLCluding without limitation items listed in our Prohibited Items Policy available at http://www.VSHORE.com/prohibited_items_policy, which is hereby LLCorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. </p>
		<p><span class="bold">Selling</span>: You must have the legal authority to sell the items that you are listing for sale through the Service. You must describe your item (LLCluding the original price) and all terms of sale in your listing truthfully, accurately and reasonably completely. If you accept an offer, you shall complete the transaction with the buyer unless the transaction is prohibited by law or these Terms of Service, subject to the return procedure described below. You are also responsible for payment of the commission to VSHORE as set forth in the Fee Policy. An offer to sell may be retracted at any time prior to its acceptance, but not after. </p>
		<p><span class="bold">Buying</span>: If you agree to purchase an item through the Service and confirm the transaction, you are obligated to complete the transaction in accordance with the terms and conditions specified by the seller (e.g., with respect to the listing price), unless the transaction is prohibited by law or these Terms of Service, subject to the return procedure described below. </p>
		<p><span class="bold">Shipping</span>: Upon the confirmation of any purchase and sale transaction through the Service and payment of the required amount by the buyer, VSHORE will send to the seller's address indicated in the seller's account information a pre-paid shipping label for seller to ship the purchased item to the buyer. The seller must ship the purchased item to the buyer using the shipping label (and corresponding shipping method) required by VSHORE within 3 days after receipt of such shipping label. If the seller does not ship the purchased item within the required time period, then the seller will be notified that the order will be cancelled unless it is shipped within the time period required in such notice. Upon receipt of confirmation from the buyer that it has satisfactorily received and accepted the purchased item, VSHORE will credit seller's account in an amount equal to the purchase price received from the buyer, minus a commission to be retained by VSHORE, as detailed in the Fee Policy. The buyer must confirm its acceptance within 3 days after receipt of the purchased item; if the buyer does not respond within such time period, the purchased item will be deemed accepted. Any funds credited to seller's account may be redeemed by the seller through a permitted third party payment provider (e.g., by ACH from VSHORE's chosen financial institution) or used by seller to purchase items listed by other sellers through the Service. </p>
		<p><span class="bold">Returns</span>: We do not currently allow returns of items, but we do strive to make our customers happy. If the item you receive is damaged, the wrong item or not as described, or if any items are missing, then you must report the issue in the VSHORE Service within 3 days after delivery of the purchased item. Alternatively, you can also email us within 3 days after delivery at <a href="mailto:cs@vshore.com">Customer Service</a> to let us know. </p>

		<h3>Arbitration</h3>
		<p>At VSHORE's or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the Service that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by binding arbitration to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California, before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS, and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS unless specifically modified in the Terms of Service. The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party. The arbitrator's decision and award shall be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in these Terms of Service and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under these Terms of Service, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (LLCluding the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding. Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, LLCluding attorneys' fees, LLCurred by the other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p>
		<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the introductory section above, if VSHORE changes this 'Arbitration' section after the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Date of Last Revision" date above or in the date of VSHORE's email to you notifying you of such change.
