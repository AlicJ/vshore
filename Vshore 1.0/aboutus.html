				</div>
				<p>Founded in 2013, Vshore is an information technology company that is dedicated to start a new era of social-generated E-commerce. 
				Coming from the combination of "Victory" and "Shore", Vshore is an entity that aligns its philosophy very much like a corsair of yester years, which were private ships commissioned by the governments to patrol and protect territorial lands. As a company that has inherited the spirits of corsair, Vshore has always been trying to build a team with integrity, creativity, diversity, and energy.</p>
